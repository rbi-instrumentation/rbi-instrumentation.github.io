Services

We are an instrumentation company based in the Grenoble area, France. We develop instrumentation and automation solutions for research and industrial needs.

Our engineering team has a very solid experience in the instrumentation field, especially:

- mechanical engineering
- electronic design

Feel free to contact us for any specific instrumentation challenge you have in mind.


Products
--------

We started developing [optical probes for dual-phase flow measurements](/probes) in 1987 with the [CEA](http://cea.fr/) to qualify multiphase flows in terms of void fraction, bubble/droplet velocity and sizes. This is still our main product today.

We make [ultrasonic generators for aerosol production](/pyrosol) for medical or industrial needs.

We have also developed a [respiratory monitoring system](http://visuresp.com/) for medical research needs and got the Artinov 2006 award for it. :-)
