ULTRASONIC GENERATOR FOR AEROSOL PRODUCTION

![principle](/assets/images/4-picture2.gif)

Principle:

If an intense beam of ultra sounds is focused near the free surface of a liquid, a fountain is formed which emits an aerosol. The sizes of droplets in his aerosol are uniform, depending on liquid characteristics and ultrasound frequency.

Application:

1. Medical — an effective way to deliver medication via the lungs.

2. Industrial — when a product can be prepared in liquid form production of aerosol is a useful way to divide a product into very small fractions of uniform size. RBI aerosol generators are used in many applications, for example:

    - thin layer realisation (optics and micro electronics)
    - thin powder production (chemistry)
    - chemical reactions between liquid and gas

3. Research laboratories — These aerosols may be used as tracers in turbulent diffusion simulations.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

RBI produces several aerosol generators. They consist in:

- a special jar, hosing the transducer, in which the aerosol takes form,
- a constant level vessel supplying the jar with the liquid,
- an electronic circuit for transducer excitation.

CHARACTERISTICS:

### PYROSOL (1) 7901 type

![principle](/assets/images/5-picture1.gif)

- 1 transducer (⌀ 38 mm)
- resonant frequency: ~ 0,8 MHz
- flow: 0 to 250 cm³/h (with water)
- droplet diameter: ~ 8 µm

### GAPUSOL (1) 9001 type

![principle](/assets/images/5-picture2.gif)

- 3 transducers (⌀ 20 mm)
- resonant frequency: ~ 2,5 MHz
- flow: 0 to 450 cm³/h (in water)
- droplet diameter: ~ 2 µm

This equipment is compatible with most for solvents used in thin layer processes.
