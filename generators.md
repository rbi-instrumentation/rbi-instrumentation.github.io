ULTRASONIC GENERATOR FOR AEROSOL PRODUCTION

![principle](/assets/images/4-picture2.gif)

Principle:

If an intense beam of ultra sounds is focused near the free surface of a liquid, a fountain is formed which emits an aerosol. The sizes of droplets in his aerosol are uniform, depending on liquid characteristics and ultrasound frequency.

Application:

1. Medical — An effective way to deliver medication via the lungs.

2. Industrial — When a product can be prepared in liquid form production of aerosol is a useful way to divide a product into very small fractions of uniform size. RBI aerosol generators are used in many applications, for example:

    - thin layer realisation (optics and micro electronics)
    - thin powder production (chemistry)
    - chemical reactions between liquid and gas

3. Research laboratories — These aerosols may be used as tracers in turbulent diffusion simulations.

Actual sizes of droplets may be measured by the RBI light scattering granulometer.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

RBI produces several aerosol generators. They consist in :
a special jar, hosing the transducer, in which the aerosol takes form,
a constant level vessel supplying the jar with the liquid,
an electronic circuit for transducer excitation.

CHARACTERISTICS:

### PYROSOL (1) 7901 type

![principle](/assets/images/5-picture1.gif)

- transducer � 40 mm
- Resonant frequency ~ 0,8 MHz
- flow : 0 to 250 cc/H (with water)
- droplet diameter ~ 8 micron

### GAPUSOL (1) 9001 type

![principle](/assets/images/5-picture2.gif)

- 3 transducers � 20 mm
- Resonant frequency ~ 2,5 MHz
- Flow : 0 to 450 cc/H (in water)
- Droplet diameter ~ 2 micron

This equipment is compatible with most for solvents used in thin layer process.

(1) Model developed in collaboration with CEA and accepted for PYROSOL application.
