VISURESP
========


VISURESP
--------

A new device for:

Respiratory monitoring & Pulmonary rehabilitation using visual feedback.

![VisuResp vest](/assets/images/6-picture1.gif)

Measured parameters:

- Rib cage Volume
- Breathing rate
- Abdominal Volume
- Ventilation
- Tidal Volume

This patented system allows long term recording.

Non invasive monitoring

Personalized rehabilitation

PRINCIPLE:

![](/assets/images/6-picture2.gif)

Thoracic and abdominal displacements are measured by a respiratory inductance plethysmograph.

CALIBRATION:

Classical method with a spirometer or flowmeter.

Calibration procedure included in the software.

APPLICATIONS:

Clinical uses Scientific uses

Training in paraplegic and quadriplegic patients who still have the ability to breathe voluntarily. Can be used to compare volitional versus automatic breathing (e.g. in breathlessness)

Prevention of alveolar collapse (atelectasis) Compute and save Vt, Ti & Te

Training thoracic wall or diaphragm separately

Monitoring of ventilation during sleep,with a calibration R.I.P. signal

Training for correct use of aerosol therapy

Possible off-line processing to obtain Vt, Ti, Te in different positions during sleep

Training for weaning from mechanical ventilation 


VISURESP
--------

View or calibration volume signal:

"VISURESP" allows real time monitoring of respiratory parameters.

Spirometry screen:

"VISURESP" provides the parameters of the selected breath (in red).
Tidal volume, expiratory & inspiratory duration.

Training screen:

![rehabilitation curve](/assets/images/7-picture1.gif)

During a training phase, the patient has a visual feedback from the target for 10 breaths, followed by no feedback for the next 5 breaths. This sequence of visible and blind phases may be repeated.

VISURESP provides a breath by breath and overall performance score.

Spirometry result tables:

Breathing can be recorded during 5 minutes.

Vt, Ti, & Te are saved (text file format).
